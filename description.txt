This project is a classic implementation of OAuth 2.0 protocol
This is a web-server flow but there can be multiple flows of token depending on application specivity

The only thing missing from this project is support for SSL for exchanging token in a secure way between clients
Encryption can be public key based in an ideal system

Google is the host of OAuth token and Stackoverflow allows user to register using OAuth Token provided by google.
